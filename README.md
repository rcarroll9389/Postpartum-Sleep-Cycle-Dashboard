Tableau Dashboard highlighting my Wife's sleep regression after our baby was born.

“Sleep when the baby sleeps”

Probably the most common advice we received before my wife gave birth a few weeks ago. While the advice was always in good spirits, the practicality of it is not always the easiest.

While I’m not usually one for social media, I wanted to make a public dashboard showing my wife’s sleep regression since our baby was born. I downloaded her Oura ring data to show just how drastic our sleep changed two weeks postpartum. We welcomed our baby girl on April 30th, and the 8+ hours of sleep we were used to, are now a thing of the past. Our little girl is amazing, born with a full head of hair, my wife’s puffy cheeks, and already giving us little fart smiles. But sleeping even short stretches in the night is not one of her strong suits.

Before the baby, my wife slept almost 9 hours on average (sleep is something we don’t sacrifice in our house). Since the baby, she’s lost about 26% of her total sleep, and while that is significant, it isn’t the whole story. Deep sleep and REM sleep are critical for brain development, repair and general healthy living. She has lost 45% deep sleep, and 37% REM sleep and her average sleep score has dropped nearly 30 points since April 30th.

While our sleep is now on the rebound, those first couple of weeks were pretty difficult for us. I don’t have an Oura ring, but I am arguably a worse sleeper than my wife, so I would love to know my data as well.

I will track this data over the next year to see how her sleep cycle changes over the course of our daughter’s first year.

Being a parent is awesome, but people were not lying when they said “enjoy your sleep before the baby comes”.

Data for the dashboard was cleaned and processed in Python. Please follow the link to my interactive tableau dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ryan.carroll5588/viz/OuraPostpartumSleepAnalysis/SleepCycleDashboard
